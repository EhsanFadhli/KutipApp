# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Flutter application designed to run completely offline, storing all necessary data on the device itself. The app will feature a modern, intuitive user interface built with a utility-first approach.

## Style & Design

- **UI Framework**: Flutter with `velocity_x` for utility-first styling.
- **Aesthetics**: A modern, clean design with a visually balanced layout, clear iconography, and a professional color scheme. The dashboard will feature prominent stat cards.
- **Navigation**: The primary navigation will be a custom bottom app bar with a central floating action button.

## Current Plan

- **Goal**: Enhance the dashboard to display key financial metrics.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a reusable `StatCard` widget for displaying key-value information (like 'Total Collected Cash').
  2. Add two instances of the `StatCard` to the dashboard's main content area.
  3. The first card will display 'Total Collected Cash' with a placeholder value in RM.
  4. The second card will display 'Monthly Fee' with a placeholder value in RM.
  5. Style the cards with a modern look, including background color, rounded corners, and appropriate text styling.
